# *Cisco Packet Tracer VLAN Office Simulation*

## *Project Description*
  This project was created to deepen my understanding of network infrastructure design using Cisco Packet Tracer, with a particular focus on how office environments connect internal departments to each other and to the internet. The simulation models a sample company consisting of five departments: Sales, Product Management, Finance, Human Resources, and Management.
The network architecture utilizes four routers and five switches, all operating within the same subnet. Each department is assigned to a dedicated VLAN, ensuring logical separation, improved security, and efficient traffic management. This design reflects common enterprise networking practices, such as VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing, and demonstrates how structured network planning can support scalability and departmental isolation within an organization.
